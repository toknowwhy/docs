# The Blocktree Structure

2ØY is building The Blocktree, the Metaverse's next-level organism after the blockchain. The Blocktree can both progressively increase scalability while decreasing latency. It is a supernet of subnetworks that optimize themselves based on a PoW incentive system. Unbounded and uncensorable!

2ØY continues the work of Satoshi by expanding the structure of the blockchain, enforcing scheduled partitions of the coin set. Developing The Blocktree, we use the Rust programming language to increase security and provide provable correctness. We are also building a PoS application networks layer over the PoW foundational blocktree layer.
