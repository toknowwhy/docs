# Welcome to The UNIT Docs

These docs are designed to describe the details of The UNIT project and present the steps toward our ultimate mission: **Unite & Build**.

## What is UNIT?

**UNIT(Ø)** is an **unbiased unit of account** created from a set of cryptocurrencies coming from an [**Open Selection Criteria**](the-unit/algorithm.md#units-selection-criteria) and glued together through an [**Open Algorithm**](the-unit/algorithm.md) that includes [**population data**](the-unit/algorithm.md#population-data).

## Why do we need UNIT?

Crypto/Web3/Blockchain is a **whole new era**. Us coming into this exciting space often see ourselves surrounded by noise from the greatest next projects. However, we don't always want to expose ourselves to great losses or invest all of our time in cryptocurrency.&#x20;

**UNIT** gives us a way to follow the entire crypto market, and invest in the space as a whole, instead of in some individual projects. **UNIT** also takes away the stress of managing our crypto portfolio, freeing us up to concentrate on other crucial and meaningful tasks.

Moreover, with its centralization and perpetual inflation, traditional fiat currency is losing its capacity to serve as a value measure in crypto, and the **increasing fragmentation** in the space is impeding crypto's growth and adoption.&#x20;

To address all these issues, crypto also needs **a common benchmark and unit of account**. A **unified** cryptocurrency space could transform the landscape, fostering the seamless integration of this new world into daily life. **UNIT** also fulfills this role.

## How does UNIT compare to existing financial products?

### S\&P 500 vs. UNIT (Index/Index Fund)

### SDR vs. UNIT (Indexed Unit)

The **SDR (Special Drawing Rights)** is an international reserve asset. It is the unit of account for the International Monetary Fund **(not a currency)**. Its value is based on a basket of five currencies—the US dollar, the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen, and the British pound sterling, which are reviewed by the **IMF** every five years.

On the other hand, UNIT is **a unit of account representing a basket of leading cryptocurrencies**. It is designed to be **a stable and reliable reference for the valuation, trading, and settlement of crypto assets**. Like SDR, UNIT aims to provide **a global standard for the cryptocurrency market, enabling more stable, decentralized, and unbiased transactions**.

### UF vs. UNIT (Unit of Account/Flatcoin)

There’s another ‘currency’ in Chile other than the Chilean Peso. It’s called **Unidad de Fomento**, or UF. To be clear, **UF isn’t an actual currency**.

UF is a store of value, it constantly **adjusts with inflation**. In other words, one UF today will buy you as many loaves of bread and gallons of gasoline as it bought five, ten, or fifteen years ago. This way, you can ensure that the purchasing power of your savings is preserved.

This is an innovative idea born from Chile’s own experience with hyperinflation several decades ago, and it should be accessible not only to Chileans but to everyone.

The UNIT agrees with UF in allowing people to **count in real value** and hold their purchasing power, in the UNIT’s case, **hold purchasing power in the crypto space**. While having the same essence of being **a unit of account that is not a currency**, the UNIT can now grow boundlessly thanks to the openness and decentralization in the cryptocurrency space. The UNIT eliminates the difficulties with UF’s high entry barrier, permissioned use, and central control over its algorithm. By replacing centralization with decentralization, we gain a more **accurate, unbiased, and accessible unit of account for DeFi**.
