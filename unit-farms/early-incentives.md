# Early Incentives

Farming will create UNIT vaults and bring a stream of incentives to participants:

1. At launch, farming participants will receive rewards in the form of new UN from the **farming pool**.&#x20;
2. Vault owners will also get paid **liquidation fees** from vaults' liquidations.&#x20;
3. TINU can give additional income to vault owners by **lending** it at the leading lending platform **Aave**.

Staking participants receive staking incentives as long as they maintain the **collateralization level** sufficiently close to the requirement.
