# The Unit Selection Criteria

Let $$S$$ be the total current supply of the Rank 1 currency (currently Bitcoin). Then the coins in The Unit must satisfy the following conditions.

1. Valuation: Market capitalization is greater than $$\frac{S}{3^5}$$.
2. Volume of Trade: The currency trades widely with at least a year of public trading. The 30D, 90D and 270D average daily volumes must be greater than $$\frac{S}{3^7}$$.
3. Issuance: The consensus rules must define the currency supply.
4. Availability: As a weak rule, 50% of the maximum supply must be available for trading in the open markets.
