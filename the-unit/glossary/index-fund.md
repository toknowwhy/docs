# Index Fund

**An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)** is a type of investment fund and exchange-traded product, traded on stock exchanges much like individual stocks. Index ETFs aim to track the performance of a specific index, offering broad market exposure, low operating expenses, and low portfolio turnover.

In traditional finance, an example of this is an ETF that tracks the S\&P 500 index, like SPY. The S\&P 500 is an index that represents the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. The goal of SPY is not to outperform these individual companies but to mirror the performance of the S\&P 500 index itself. This provides investors with a way to gain broad exposure to the entire market of large-cap U.S. stocks, rather than trying to pick individual stocks.

In the world of DeFi, similar principles apply. The UNIT represents the market average of DeFi by selecting the top coins into the index basket. Our **UNIT ETF (TINU)\***, then, is designed to track the performance of UNIT. The goal of TINU is not to outperform the individual assets within the UNIT index basket, but to mirror the overall performance of UNIT, which is the market’s overall performance. This allows investors to gain broad exposure to the whole DeFi market, without needing to pick and choose individual cryptocurrencies and being stressed about it. We don’t know what a specific coin will do but we know the overall market will continue to grow.
