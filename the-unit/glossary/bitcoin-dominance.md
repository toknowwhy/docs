# Bitcoin Dominance

Imagine the entire cryptocurrency market as a pie. Each slice of the pie represents a different cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin typically being the largest slice. The size of Bitcoin's slice compared to the entire pie is its dominance. It's calculated as Bitcoin's market capitalization divided by the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies and It's an important metric in the crypto space, often used by traders and analysts to understand Bitcoin's relative strength and influence in the market.

Trading bitcoin dominance with the wBTC/TINU pair allows investors to invest in the performance of the entire crypto market as represented by UNIT. When you trade this pair, you are essentially comparing the performance of Bitcoin (via wBTC) with the broader crypto market (represented by TINU).

* **Buy wBTC with TINU:** When you believe that Bitcoin will perform better than the broader crypto market, possibly due to its perceived stability or potential for growth compared to other coins.
* **Sell wBTC for TINU:** When you believe that the overall crypto market (as per UNIT) will outperform Bitcoin specifically. By holding TINU, you're effectively moving your investment from solely Bitcoin to a broader range of cryptocurrencies.
