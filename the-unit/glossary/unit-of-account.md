# Unit of Account

Do you know that UF, a unit of account in Chile is not a currency but an index? It adjusts daily according to changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which maintains a stable value in a high-inflation environment.

A unit of account provides a common standard measure for measuring prices for goods and services in an economy, which simplifies the process of setting prices and making economic calculations. It is one of the three functions of money, along with being a medium of exchange and a store of value.

For fiat currencies like the USD, changes in the economy, such as inflation or changes in interest rates, can cause the value of the currency to fluctuate, which erodes their purchasing power over time. A central authority regulates them, the Central Bank, which can adjust monetary policy to manage economic conditions. However, this also means that the value of the currency can be influenced by political decisions and economic mismanagement.

For cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the value can fluctuate dramatically due to speculation, market sentiment, regulatory news, technological developments, community support, and bugs. These risks and added volatility can make it difficult for single cryptocurrencies to be adopted as a stable unit of account.

UNIT is changing this by stepping up as an indexed unit of account in the cryptocurrency world. It uses an algorithm to create a self-updating basket of cryptocurrencies, providing a stable and reliable measure of value in the often volatile DeFi world. This basket forms an indexed unit of account for the future financial system, replacing less relevant USD pairs and charts. It reduces reliance on a single volatile coin and provides a holistic view of the market, making investment decisions easier.
