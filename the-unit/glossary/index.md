# Index

In the context of the stock market, an index is a tool used to represent the performance of the whole or a part of the stock market. It is calculated from the prices or market capitalizations of selected stocks (typically a weighted average). Examples of well-known stock market indices include the S\&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Nasdaq Composite Index, and the Russell 2000. Indices provide a benchmark for individual stocks and funds to truly judge their performance against the performance of the entire market or a market segment.

In the Web3 Industry, **UNIT** wants the index idea to become better than ever. Instead of letting a small group pick cryptocurrencies for the index basket, UNIT is a **decentralized crypto index** regulated by a **human-centric algorithm** and governed by the UNIT DAO. UNIT guarantees that the ongoing reconstitution of the index occurs with complete transparency and fairness.
