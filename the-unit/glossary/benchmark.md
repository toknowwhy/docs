# Benchmark

In finance, a benchmark is a standard against which the performance of a security, mutual fund, or investment can be measured. For instance, stock market indexes like the S\&P 500 serve as benchmarks for measuring the performance of investment funds.

A "crypto-based benchmark" refers to a standard or metric used to evaluate the performance of cryptographic coins. However, the success and effectiveness of such a benchmark would largely depend on its adoption, accuracy in reflecting the market, and ability to maintain its unbiased stance. Thus, we deeply believe that such a benchmark CANNOT be any specific coin, and therefore, we created UNIT.

UNIT is a crypto-based index that algorithmically and automatically selects the top-performing coins. By being an index, it stably shows the overall market performance using top cryptocurrencies without being any coin. It is a significant tool for benchmarking and understanding the cryptocurrency space. By focusing on the true price of these assets, as opposed to fiat-based prices, UNIT provides a clearer picture of true market movements, freeing crypto from the inflationary impacts of fiat currencies.
