# Population Data

Currently, we use the population data estimated by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs [Population Division](https://population.un.org/). We found this to be the most accurate.

In the future, we would like to collaborate with several population oracles to update this data more often and increase its accuracy.

The slow update of this data is acceptable for the correct functioning of UNIT since population and life expectancy at birth data changes slowly from year to year.
