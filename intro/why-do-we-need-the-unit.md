# Why do we need UNIT?

Crypto/Web3/Blockchain is a **whole new era**. Us coming into this exciting space often see ourselves surrounded by noise from the greatest next projects. However, we don't always want to expose ourselves to great losses or invest all of our time in cryptocurrency. **UNIT** gives us a way to follow the entire crypto market, and invest in the space as a whole, instead of in some individual projects. **UNIT** also deletes the hassle of managing our crypto portfolio when we have other more meaningful and important things to do.

Moreover, with its centralization and perpetual inflation, traditional fiat currency is losing its capacity to serve as a value measure in crypto, and the **increasing fragmentation** in the space is impeding crypto's growth and adoption.&#x20;

To address all these issues, crypto also needs **a common benchmark and unit of account**. A **unified** cryptocurrency space could transform the landscape, fostering the seamless integration of this new world into daily life. **UNIT** also fulfills this role.
