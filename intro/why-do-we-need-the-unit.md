# Why do we need UNIT?

Crypto/Web3/Blockchain is a **whole new era**. Those coming into this exciting space often see themselves surrounded by noise from the greatest next projects. However, not everybody wants to expose themselves to great losses or invest all of their time in cryptocurrency. **UNIT** gives participants a way to follow the entire crypto market, investing in the space as a whole, instead of in some particular projects. **UNIT** also deletes the hassle of managing your crypto portfolio when you have other more meaningful and important things to do.

Moreover, with its centralization and perpetual inflation, traditional fiat currency is losing its capacity to serve as a value measure in crypto, and the **increasing fragmentation** in the space is impeding crypto's growth and adoption.&#x20;

To address these issues, crypto also needs **a common unit of account**. A **unified** cryptocurrency space could transform the landscape, fostering the seamless integration of this new world into daily life. **UNIT** also fulfills this role.
