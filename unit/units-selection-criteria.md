# UNIT's Selection Criteria

Let $$S$$ be the total current supply of the Rank 1 currency (currently Bitcoin), and let $$\phi$$ be the golden ratio $$\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$$. Then the coins creating UNIT must satisfy the following conditions.

1. Valuation: The 180D average daily market capitalization must be greater than $$\frac{S}{\phi^{12}}\approx\frac{S}{322}$$.
2. Volume of Trade: The currency trades widely with at least a year of public trading. If $$R$$ is the 180D average market capitalization to trading volume ratio\*. The 180D average daily volumes must be greater than $$\frac{S}{\phi^{12}R}$$.
3. Issuance: The consensus rules must define the currency supply.
4. Availability: As a weak rule, 50% of the supply must be available for trading.

\* For a calculation of $$R$$ see [average-market-cap-to-volume-ratio.md](average-market-cap-to-volume-ratio.md "mention").
