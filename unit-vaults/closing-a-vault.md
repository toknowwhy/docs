# Closing a Vault

Participants **control their vaults** as long as the collateral doesnâ€™t fall below the **liquidation level**.&#x20;

To recover the collateral, vault owners must return all the **TINU** to the vault. As long as there is a TINU debt to the vault the collateral remaining must be greater than the **minimum deposit value** of **100 TINU**.
