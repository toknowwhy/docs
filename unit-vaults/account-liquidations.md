# Account Liquidations

Suppose an account's collateralization ratio falls below the **liquidation level**. In that case, the account owner will have **72 hours** to bring the vault back over the liquidation level by **adding more collateral or burning TINU**. However, after 72 hours, **anyone can claim** the collateral locked in the contract by burning the required amount of TINU set in the liquidation parameters.

The vault owner will pay a **liquidation fee** for the risk added to the system.
