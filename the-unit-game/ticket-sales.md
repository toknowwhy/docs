# Ticket Sales

On day 1 of the round, tickets (yUNIT and nUNIT) are priced in UNIT at the rate of&#x20;

$$
1 \;\textrm{UNIT}= (1-p) \;\textrm{yUNIT},
$$

$$
1 \;\textrm{UNIT}= p\;\textrm{nUNIT},
$$

for $$p$$ being the probability of "yes".

This yields that the total number of UNIT deposited into the pool is equal to the total number of yUNIT and nUNIT tickets issued.

On subsequent days, ticket prices also depend on the probability of the outcome on a given day.&#x20;

In the Ethereum network, for $$V$$ the price of 1 ETH in UNIT and $$p$$ the updated probability of "yes" we get that 1 ETH will yield the following amount of yUNIT and nUNIT tickets.

$$
1 \;\textrm{ETH}= V * (1-p) \;\textrm{yUNIT},
$$

$$
1 \;\textrm{ETH}= V * p \;\textrm{nUNIT}.
$$
