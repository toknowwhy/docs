# Ticket Sales

On day 1 of the round, tickets (yUNIT and nUNIT) are priced in UNIT at the rate of 1 UNIT = 1 ticket.

On subsequent days, ticket prices also depend on the probability of the outcome on a given day.&#x20;

In the Ethereum network, for $$V$$ the price of 1 ETH in UNIT and $$p$$ the probability of yes we get that 1 ETH will yield the following amount of yUNIT and nUNIT tickets.

$$
1 \;\textrm{ETH}= V * (1-p) \;\textrm{yUNIT}
$$

$$
1 \;\textrm{ETH}= V * p \;\textrm{nUNIT}
$$
