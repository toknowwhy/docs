# Game Steps

1. A player can purchase YES or NO tickets by depositing into the Prize Pool.&#x20;
2. Once a deposit is made, YES or NO tickets are minted and sent to the player's wallet.&#x20;
3. Since one round will last multiple days the funds in the Prize Pool are deposited into Yield Source to grow the final Prize Pool and the Protocol Reserve.&#x20;
4. The Protocol Reserve will then accrue the total funds from the Yield Source and deposit funds into the Prize Distributor for players to claim their Prizes given they have the winning tickets.
5. Players claim their prizes.
