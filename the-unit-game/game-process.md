# Game Process

## Game Steps

1. A player can purchase YES or NO tickets by depositing into the Prize Pool.&#x20;
2. Once a deposit is made, YES or NO tickets are minted and sent to the player's wallet.&#x20;
3. Since one round will last multiple days the funds in the Prize Pool are deposited into a Yield Source to grow the final Prize Pool and the Protocol Reserve.&#x20;

5. Players claim their prizes.

2. Players make their bets.
