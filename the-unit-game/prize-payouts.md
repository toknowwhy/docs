# Prize Payouts

Prizes will be distributed evenly among all winning tickets. Payouts are given to both yUNIT holders and nUNIT holders.&#x20;

Given a total payout of $$x$$ UNIT and a total number of $$y$$ winning tickets. $$\displaystyle\frac{x}{y}$$ will be the UNIT value reward for each ticket.

For yUNIT holders, the prize is the total amount of deposits into the prize pool; while for nUNIT holders, the prize is the total amount of yield accrued from the yield source.
