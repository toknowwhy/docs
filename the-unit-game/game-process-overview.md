# Game Process Overview

## Basic Steps

1. A player can purchase yUNIT or nUNIT tickets by depositing into the Prize Pool.&#x20;
2. Once a deposit is made, yUNIT or nUNIT tickets are minted and sent to the player's wallet.&#x20;
3. Since one round will last multiple days the funds in the Prize Pool are deposited into a Yield Source to grow the final Prize Pool and the Protocol Reserve.&#x20;
4. The Protocol Reserve will then accrue the total funds from the Yield Source and deposit funds into the Prize Distributor for players to claim their Prizes given they have the winning tickets.
5. Players claim their prizes.

## Basic Game Rules

1. A question is posted.
2. Players make their deposits.
3. The outcome is decided.
4. Players claim their prizes.

## Game Period

Each round will take 13 days to complete. However, outcomes might be decided earlier.
