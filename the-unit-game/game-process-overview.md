# Game Process Overview

## Basic Steps

1. A player can purchase yUNIT or nUNIT tickets by depositing into the Prize Pool.&#x20;
2. Once a deposit is made, yUNIT or nUNIT tickets are minted and sent to the player's wallet.&#x20;
3. Since one round will last multiple days the funds in the Prize Pool are deposited into a Yield Source to grow the final Prize Pool and the Protocol Reserve.&#x20;

5. Players claim their prizes.

2. Players make their bets.
