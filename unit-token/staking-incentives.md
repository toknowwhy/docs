# Staking Incentives

Creating a vault and staking collateral into a UNIT vault brings a stream of incentives to the vault owners. At launch, staking participants will receive staking rewards in the form of new UNT from the farming pool.

Staking participants receive staking incentives as long as they maintain the collateralization level sufficiently close to the requirement.
