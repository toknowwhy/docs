# Collateralized Vaults: UNIT Minting, Burning

The Unit’s native and governance token is UNT. The UNIT token is a soft peg to The Unit Index, the crypto-native benchmark.\


UNIT Vaults are collateralized by assets agreed to by The Unit governance through the UNT token voting. The minimum collateralization level depends on the price ranges in UNIT of the asset used in the particular vault. Each vault only contains one particular asset and a set of parameters. Currently, UNITI is the sole collateral source, but The Unit governance will soon consider other sources of collateral.\


To mint UNIT, participants must deposit The Unit’s native token UNT into UNIT vaults (other collaterals in the future). Vaults have a set of risk parameters to ensure the stability of UNIT and the peg to The Unit Index. The risk parameters are:

* Debt Ceiling
* Index Fee APY
* Liquidation Ratio
* Liquidation Fee

UNIT is burned to retrieve the collateral in the vaults. Every time UNIT is burned, a fee depending on the staking level will be charged and distributed to the remaining staking participants. At a level higher than 76.4%, the fee will be 0.5% and increase linearly to 5% at 0%.
