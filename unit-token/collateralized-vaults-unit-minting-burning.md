# Collateralized Vaults: UNIT Minting, Burning

UNIT vaults are collateralized using assets admitted by The Unit governance. Currently, **UNT** is the sole collateral source, but The Unit governance will soon consider **other collateral sources**, such as the native tokens of **Ethereum, BSC, Polygon**... To mint UNIT, participants must deposit The Unitâ€™s native token UNT into UNIT vaults.&#x20;

Each vault only contains one particular asset and a set of **risk parameters** to ensure the stability of UNIT:

* **Minimum Collateralization Level**
* **Debt Ceiling**
* **Index Fee APY**
* **Liquidation Ratio**
* **Liquidation Fee**

The minimum collateralization level to mint UNIT depends on the **price range in UNIT** of the asset used in the particular vault. This ensures that the vault will be protected **against high-volatility events**.

UNIT is burned to retrieve the collateral in the vaults. Every time UNIT is burned, a fee depending on the staking level will be charged and distributed to the remaining staking participants.
