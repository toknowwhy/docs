# Staking Incentives

Staking collateral into a UNIT vault brings a stream of incentives to the vault owners:

1. At launch, staking participants will receive staking rewards in the form of new UNT from the **farming pool**.&#x20;
2. Vault owners will get paid from the **liquidation fee**.&#x20;
3. UNIT can give additional income from **lending** it at the leading lending platform **Aave**.

Staking participants receive staking incentives as long as they maintain the **collateralization level** sufficiently close to the requirement.
