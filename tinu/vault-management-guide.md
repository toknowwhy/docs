# Vault Management Guide

To mint UNIT, you need to deposit collateral into a vault. Vaults are available for different collateral types.

## Opening a Vault and Minting UNIT

1. First, choose the type of collateral you would like to use to mint UNIT.
   * The available collaterals are ETH and the ERC20 tokens DAI, USDT, USDC, and WBTC.
2. Choose an amount of collateral to be deposited into the vault.
3. Choose an amount of UNIT to mint.
4. Track the collateralization ratio and liquidation price to avoid liquidations. A vault liquidation has a hefty penalty fee and should be avoided.

## Avoiding Liquidation (Vault Management)

1. Keeping track of the collateralization ratio and preventing your collateral from going under the liquidation price is essential.
2. You can deposit more collateral into your vault and return some or all of the minted UNIT at any time.

## Decrease and Close a Vault

To decrease and close a vault, you must return the minted UNIT and withdraw your collateral.
