# Collateralized Vaults: TINU Minting & Burning

UNIT vaults are collateralized using assets admitted by The UNIT governance. Currently, **ETH** is the sole collateral source, but The UNIT governance will soon consider **other collateral sources**, such as the native tokens of **BSC, Polygon,** and others**.** To mint TINU, participants must deposit ETH into UNIT vaults.&#x20;

Each vault only contains one particular asset and a set of **risk parameters** to ensure the stability of TINU:

* **Debt Ceiling**
* **Liquidation Ratio**
* **Liquidation Fee**

The minimum collateralization level to mint TINU depends on the **1-year price range in UNIT** of the asset used in the particular vault. This ensures that the vault will be protected **against high-volatility events**.

TINU is burned to retrieve the collateral in the vaults. Every time TINU is burned, a fee depending on the staking level will be charged and distributed to the remaining staking participants.
